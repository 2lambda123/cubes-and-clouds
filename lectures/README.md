# Lectures
This is the place where the content of the lectures is stored. Every lecture has its own folder. 

## Structure
In the lectures folder there is 
- Markdown File: the main mark down file compiling all the information that will be displayed in the course. 
- Assets: a folder called `assests`. It holds all media used in the lecture, e.g. images, videos, interactive graphics, code snippets, etc.
- Exercises: We still have to agree how to host the exercises
