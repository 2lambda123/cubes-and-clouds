## Introduction / Definition
* What is a platform?
- Why do I need a platform?
- Animation: Growth in satellites and data volumes

Exercise: Calculate amount of Sentinel-2 data needed for our analysis (2015-2023, 5d, bands, region crossing tiles, download time, storage amount, software solutions needed)

## Types of platforms
* Data and Infrastruture providers
	* Amazon Web Services
	* Google Cloud
	* Cloudferro
	* Open Telekom Cloud
* Platform providers
	* Copernicus DIAS
	* Microsoft Planetary Computer
	* Euro Data Cube
	* ESA Thematic Exploitation Platforms
	* Google Earth Engine
	* Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem
	* Sentinel-Hub
	* OpenEO Platform

Topics: 
- How do I connect to a platform?
* What different types of platforms exist?

Exercise: Use two platforms to search for two different datasets. 

## Components of a platform
* Infrastructure
	* Compute system (e.g., Virtual Machines, Kubernetes, HPC)
	* Storage (e.g., used for input data, resulting data, temporary data; Local Storage, Object Storage)
* Data discovery / selection (Where to find data?)
* Data access (Local file paths, HTTP(S), S3)
* Data processing (e.g., how to start a processing: Containers, )
* User interfaces (e.g., JupyterLab/Notebook, Client applications - e.g., webeditors)

Animation: Building Blocks of a cloud platform. Shows names of parts (and their role) upon mouse hovering.

Exercise: Building blocks of a Platform: Drag and drop them into a correct diagram, or name the diagram – what would change in a federated platform

## Aspects of platform federation
- Why do we need federated platforms?
- How can we achieve federated platforms?
	- Standardized APIs (OGC, EOEPCA)
	- Example federation: OpenEO

Exercise: Create a simple API from a simple function – where does standardization come into play
