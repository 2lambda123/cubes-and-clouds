# 3.4 Data Sharing

## Introduction
We have reached the last chapter of the course. You know everything about data cubes, cloud platforms and open science now. Now it's time to prove it! We will apply everything we have learned so far and complete our own EO workflow on a cloud platform adhering to the open science principles
We have carried out a full EO workflow to produce our snow cover information. Now the results are produced. To make them impactful we need make them available to other researchers and whoever else is interested. Therefore we are going to learn how to share our data set (and code) properly - following the FAIR principles. We have learned about the concepts of open science in lecture 1.3 open science. Now we are going to apply our theortical knowledge!

We are going to
- Produce our own results
  - Reuse process graph of 3.3
  - Choose a sutiable region and timescale 
    - according to resources
    - best would be to link to the already generated results so that the choice makes more sense (i.e. closing the alps)
    - Add a 1000m line there to show the relevant areas
    - Add some snow stations for validation
    - setup stack catalogue for this
  - Validate our result --> Report Accuracy
- Open our research
  - Make the data fair
    - fill stac metadata
    - choose a license
    - publish the data
    - make the code available that we have used
  - (Make the code fair) 

## Exercise
- Produce Data: Reuse Processgraph, only change some things
   - extents
   - aggregation method: yearly mean of winter months
- Validate Data: Choose closest station? --> Report Accuracy
- Open Science
  - Fill STAC Catalogue
  - Upload Data -> COG
  - Upload Code -> Processgraph
  - Add a license
  - (DOI)

## Quiz
- We should only check that the data is availalbe on our hosting.
- We should check the STAC entry
- Submit the process graph 
- Sort FAIR to what we have done
  - F: Findable - Searchable STAC CATALOGUE
  - A: Accessible - Available on an open platform/host
  - I: Interoperable - using standard formats COG
  - R: Reproducible - Publishing of the process graph

## Notes
### Topics
- We have a result, what now?
- Making the result FAIR, step by step

### TO DO:
- Where to host the results?!?!?!

### Exercises
- Apply the steps of making a result FAIR to the result obtained
- Make sure it is also reproducible
- Publish the result in an open map via COGS?
