## Cloud native data formats

### What are cloud native data formats
Cloud native formats or cloud-optimized formats, are file formats specifically designed to optimize the storage, access, and processing of geospatial data in cloud computing environments. These formats are tailored to leverage the scalability, flexibility, and parallel processing capabilities of cloud infrastructure, enabling efficient handling of large-scale datasets.

### Characteristics of cloud native data formats
Cloud-optimized means mainly optimized "read" access with partial reads and also parallel reads. Main characteristics common for cloud-optimized formats:

- **Data Chunking:** Cloud native formats employ a chunk-based organization, where the data is divided into smaller chunks or blocks. This enables parallel processing and efficient retrieval of specific portions of the data, reducing the need to access the entire dataset.

- **Internal Indexing:** These formats incorporate internal indexing structures that facilitate fast spatial and attribute queries. This enables efficient data access and retrieval operations without the need for extensive scanning or processing of the entire dataset.

- **Metadata Optimization:** Cloud native formats optimize metadata storage and indexing, allowing for efficient access and retrieval of metadata associated with the data at once. This supports faster discovery and interpretation of data properties and characteristics.

- **Compression and Tiling:** Cloud native formats often employ advanced compression techniques to reduce storage requirements while maintaining data quality. Additionally, they utilize tiling strategies to divide the data into smaller, manageable tiles that can be independently accessed and processed.

HTTP Range Request allows clients to request only a specific portion or range of data instead of a complete dataset.

### Examples of cloud native data formats

- **COG** - Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is an optimized version of the GeoTIFF format. It organizes raster data into chunks, utilizes internal tiling and compression, and uses HTTP range requests for efficient data access in the cloud.
- **ZARR** Zarr is a format specifically designed for storing and accessing multidimensional arrays. It supports chunking, compression, and parallel processing, making it suitable for large-scale geospatial datasets, for example, weather data. Metadata is stored externally in data files itself.
- **FlatGeoBuf** Cloud optimized vector data format. It is a binary encoding format for geodata and holds a collection of Simple Features.

## Quiz
What are cloud native data formats in EO and GIS

    [(X)] Cloud native data formats in EO should be compatible to cloud services (APIs, http requests, cloud storage), enable fast viewing and access to spatial sub regions.
    [( )] Cloud native data formats in EO are exclusively designed to be compressed as much as possible, so that the least amount of storage space is necessary.
    [( )] Cloud native data formats in EO have to be human readable when you open them in a text editor.

Connect the cloud native data format and it's predecessor to it's spatial data type (https://www.ogc.org/blog-article/towards-a-cloud-native-geospatial-standards-baseline/, (https://cholmes.medium.com/an-overview-of-cloud-native-vector-c223845638e0)
