## Exercises 

- Fill STAC catalogue for a data source 

- Extract metadata from openEO Platform, e.g. make a histogram of the resolutions on openEO platform

- Calculate volume of data needed for the snow workflow according to the collections, timesteps, bands, resolutions, spatial extent selected in previous chapter, value types, format, compression estimate, etc.
