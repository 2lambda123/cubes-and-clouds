# 3.2 Scaling

## Learning Objectives
- Learn why scaling design is important
- Scaling options - speed/data size, horizontally/vertically
- How to estimatate costs of scaling 



## Introduction
This lesson is focusing on applying knowledge obtained in previous lesson to larger scale. First, we will look into different scaling options and terminology. After that we will talk about code optimalization and possibilities of scaling on platforms. Lastly we will look at cost estimates. After going through the theory, we will apply newly gained knowledge to practice - directly on our EO workflow. 



 **VIDEO: Scaling importance...**

We are going to
- learn:
  - What is scaling
  - horizontal vs. vertical scalling
  - How to make a workflow scalable, what to avoid
  - Cloud native scaling 
  - Limitations of the scaling
- explore:
  - subscription vs. on demand usage
  - Cost of scalability
  - Memory consumption
  - Difference between platform usage and cloud directly
- try:
  - Monitor your usage
  - Code optimalization to reduce costs and time
  - Concrete examples of costs of scaling



## Exercise
- Based on the previous exercises, calculate how much resources it would take to produce the snow result for: 
  - Europe, 
  - the whole world,
  - one time step, 
  - one year, 
  - multi year 
- Things to avoid:
  - loading whole dataset
  - listing big directories in jupyterLab
  - letting your code run unattanded
- Datacube chuncking - when to chunk by time and when to chucnk by area

## Quiz
- What are limitations of scaling
- What do not have effect on speed of processing?
- You have X processors with XXX amount of RAM  - what can you do to improve it?
