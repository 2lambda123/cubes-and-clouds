# Data Discovery

## What kind of data is available 
- raster data
    - satellite data
    - drone orthophoto
    - DEM
- vector data
    - land/sea mask
    - surface classification mask
    - cloud mask
- in-situ data
    - e.g. temperature measurement

## Where to search
- Copernicus Open Access Hub - https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ (OpenSearch API or OpenData API) - To be replaced by CDSE
- Open Science Catalog
- SentinelHub API - https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/api/catalog/


## Filtering properties
- (most common)
- time range
- bounding box or other area of interest
- mission
- processing levels
- sensors
- cloud coverage/polarization
- orbit number
- orbit direction
- availability status
