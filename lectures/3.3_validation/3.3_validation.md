# Validation

## Learning objectives
- Get to know typical validation strategies in EO
- Understand why validation is important
- The validation of large scale mapping products
- Validate some pixels of the snow cover area map

## What is validation
- Definition of validation in EO
- The importance of validation

## Typical validation approaches
- Ways of doing proper accuracy assessment (methods)
- How to express the certainty of the map/pixels (measures)
- Taking into account the accuracy of the validation data
- How to properly state the limitations of a map (what is still not quantifiable after the validation)
- How to publish the validation results with the main product

## The validation of large scale mapping products
- The difficulty of validating global/continental data sets
- Producing Global/Continental data sets, the spatial distribution of sample/training/validation points and extrapolation into the unknown (e.g. trained model into amazonas/sahara, downscaling climate variables into the high mountains) -> S14Science in Amazonas (ground truth in remote locations)

## Exercise
- Validate some pixels of the SCA map produced before
- Use station data from ClirSnow Project: https://clirsnow.netlify.app/dash-results/dash-climatology.html#explore-climatic-boundaries
  - There seem to be 4-6 stations in the catchment
- Express the accuracy correctly, publish it with the result (metadata or layer)

## Quiz
- Dropdown select the accuracy the SCA map at a station (result of the exercise)
