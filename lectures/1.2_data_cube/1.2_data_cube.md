- **SUGGESTION: make it clear this is about geospatial data cubes**
- **SUGGESTION: bubliography for gridded data cubes: https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5649/**

#### Video: The role of data cubes in EO
- Explain the role of data cubes in EO
  - From files with limitations to a virtual multi dimensional data cube
  - Explain dimensionality
  - What does a data cube allow doing, that traditional file access doesn't
- Explain the role of data cubes in EO cloud platforms
  - Uniform way of accessing mulitple different data sources (e.g. MODIS, Sentinel-3)
  - How data cubes are integrated in cloup platforms: a data cube is the data base (e.g. ODC) it integrates well with metadata (e.g. STAC) and processing (e.g. openEO)

## Dimenesions 
- integrate this content: https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/datacubes.html#dimensions
- Resolutions

## Data Cubes in Cloud Platforms
- Describe the role of data cubes in cloud platforms
- A cube is not a platform -> How a data cube is made up out of files
- Data Cube managment systems: ODC, Rasdaman, GDAL Cubes

## Quiz
- Name the typical dimensions of an EO data cube
- Name the resolutions of the dimensions
