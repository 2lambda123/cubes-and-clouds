# What is a data cube?

## Learning objectives
- Understand what data cubes are and why they are needed
- Learn what dimensions are
- Understand the role of data cubes in EO cloud platforms


## Brief History of Data Cubes
Data Cubes have been invented in the ecnonomic sciences. 


## Data Cubes in EO
The concept of representing multidimensional data as data cubes fits ideally to the challenges of representing satellite data that is usually dealing with multiple dimensions such as: lat, lon, time, bands, ... . In the video below it becomes very clear what the strengths of data cubes in EO are.

#### Video: The role of data cubes in EO
- Explain the role of data cubes in EO
  - Difficulties of representing/viewing/storing EO Data -> The need for data cubes
  - From files with limitations to a virtual multi dimensional data cube
  - Explain dimensionality
  - What does a data cube allow doing, that traditional file access doesn't
- Explain the role of data cubes in EO cloud platforms
  - Uniform way of accessing mulitple different data sources (e.g. MODIS, Sentinel-3)
  - How data cubes are integrated in cloup platforms: a data cube is the data base (e.g. ODC) it integrates well with metadata (e.g. STAC) and processing (e.g. openEO)

### Data Cubes in Cloud Platforms
One important feature of an EO cloud platform is to host satellite data. Usually vast amounts of satellite data, for example the whole archive of Landsat and the Sentinels which adds up to Petabytes of data. Users want to access this data efficiently. Therefore the storage system of an EO cloud platform needs to be optimized towards user requests. Data Cubes play an important role here. Organizing the raw files into virtual data cubes solves many issues for EO cloud platforms.

- **Data Manaegement:** Different Satellites have different formats and are structured differently. This can easily create confusion because the different sources have to be treated differently. After organizing these files into data cubes the interaction with all different satellite data follows the same rules. 
- **Seperated Collections:** Every satellite missions is there own data cube also called collection with it's metadata. Ideally cloud processing tools on the platform allow for easy data fusion of differenct collections.
- **Flexible Subsetting:** [Data Cube Management Systems](https://github.com/EO-College/cubes-and-clouds/blob/main/lectures/1.2_data_cube/1.2_data_cube.md#further-reading) are developed to facilitate subsetting operations along the different dimensions and return only the required subset. Without worrying about the different raw files that are involved (e.g. area of interest is crossing a tile border).

**Note: Remember, a data cube is not an EO cloud platform. It's only one part of it.**
