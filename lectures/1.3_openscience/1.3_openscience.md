## What is Open Science
### Definition
Open Science offers new opportunities in dealing with scientific knowledge and represents a kind of cultural change. Through transparency and openness, Open Science increases the use and further development of knowledge as well as the potential for collaboration and the credibility of science. The focus is on free access to scientific processes and findings for everyone via the internet and the right to re-use this content. The beneficiaries of this concept are not only science, but also society and the economy.

Open Science is realised through various strategies and procedures, such as free access to scientific publications (Open Access), computer programmes (Open Source Software), data (Open Data) and educational materials (Open Educational Resources).

### The 4 Rs of Open Science
When opening your science think about the 4 Rs:
- **Reliable.** It is important to evaluate the research in two ways. First with respect to scientific principles and criteria like validity, second with respect to criteria out of the professional context. This will help ensure that your results are more reliable.
- **Reproducible.** Transparency is critical when doing research. Open Science allows you to clearly show what you've done to get the results you have. By being open about your methods, processes and decision making during your research, someone else doing the research again should get the same results.
- **Reusable.** This is the same R we mentioned when we talked about FAIR. By making a research results reusable, you allow others to build upon the solid foundation your research has already created in a given subject.
- **Relevant.** Research quality describes the measurable influence of academic research on the academic community. Research impact includes environmental, cultural and societal impact, economic returns and societal benefits.

### The four pillars of Open Science
> Maybe drop this here: is too repetitive and will be covered in the respective sections again

The four pillars of Open Science are: 
- **Data.** Data-driven research is fast becoming the norm in all disciplines. To support validation of your findings and allow others to build upon your work, you first need to make sure that others can find your data. This means giving them unique identifiers (such as DOIs); putting them into a repository that supports public searching; and being clear about what others can and can't do with them by applying an appropriate license. Check out our course on managing and sharing research data for more information. To find the right license for your outputs, check out our open licensing course
- **Code.** When sharing your software and code, be sure to make use of open source standards to support interoperability and their longer-term viability. Be sure to put your code somewhere that others can search for it and access it (e.g., Github). You should also be clear about the license the code is being shared under. Learn more about looking after your code in our course covering open source software and workflows. Our course on open licensing will help you to find the best option for your software outputs. 
- **Papers.** Open Access to publications is a key component of Open Science. Free and instant access to publications improves the speed of innovation and leads better cooperation and progress in solving grand challenges. To publish openly, you'll need to be able to source an appropriate OA journal or discipline specific repository and navigate your way through their publishing agreements. You should also consider sharing preprints of your work as a means of getting early feedback and community validation of your approaches. In some cases, you'll need to pay an Article Processing Charge to publish in an OA journal. Learn more about these issues in our Open Access publishing course.  
- **Reviews.** The peer review process is evolving. By making the peer review process more transparent, researchers have better access to peer feedback at an earlier stage in the lifecycle and consumers of research outputs can have greater confidence in their quality. Learn more about how this in our open peer review (OPR) course. 

But there is way more to discover about Open Science. The Open [Science Taxonomy graphic](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1508606.v3, "Knoth, Petr; Pontika, Nancy (2015): Open Science Taxonomy. figshare. Figure. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1508606.v3") shows the different terms behind Open Science.

- Examples for every letter
  - Findable: 
    - The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.
    - FINDABLE: To** enable its discovery, data should be described with rich metadata, and it should be assigned a persistent identifier, such as a digital object identifier or DOI**. These metadata should be available online in a searchable resource such as a data catalog or repository.
  - Accessible: 
    - Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
    - ACCESSIBLE: Metadata and/or the data themselves should be retrievable via their persistent identifier using a standard communication protocol, such as HTTP or HTTPS. This means that following the persistent identifier should take you to the metadata or data. However, keep in mind that accessible does not mean that data must be open in the sense that there are no access restrictions. It rather means that if data has access conditions, these are clear to both humans and machines. Therefore the protocol for accessing the data should allow for an authentication and authorization procedure where necessary. In addition, metadata should be accessible even if the data themselves are no longer available.
  - Interoperable: 
    - The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. 
    - INTEROPERABLE: Whenever possible, metadata and data should use recognized standards. By using formats, terms or vocabularies, that a community has agreed upon, we make sure our data is understandable by others but we also make possible for data to be exchanged and combined across computer systems. Interoperability also involves providing context by including references to other relevant metadata and data. For example by linking to another data set on which your data set is built.
  - Reusable:
    - The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.
    - REUSABLE: Data should not only be available, but also effectively reusable. To achieve this, data should be abundantly described and documented in accordance with community standards. Metadata and documentation should be able to answer the W-questions, to help others understand what we call the provenance of the data. In other words, where did data come from and what happened to them along the way. All of this is needed when we want others to understand the context of the data and judge how relevant and useful they are. It increases trust and the likelihood of reuse to make data reusable. We also need to let others know what kinds of reuse are permitted, by including a clear data usage license.

- What is the community effect of Open Street Map
- How does it evolve towards cloud native EO
- Open Science in the Cloud: The Open Street Map base map is used as a background layer in almost every webmapping tool available. It allows users to quickly recognize the location of EO data to the known features on a map (i.e., country borders, streets, buildings).
  - Show result of EO data without a base map, upon click: and with a base map to illustrate how base maps help recognizing the data spatially.
