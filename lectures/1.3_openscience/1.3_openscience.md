## What is Open Science?
### Definition
Open Science offers new opportunities in dealing with scientific knowledge and represents a kind of cultural change. Through transparency and openness, Open Science increases the use and further development of knowledge as well as the potential for collaboration and the credibility of science. The focus is on free access to scientific processes and findings for everyone via the internet and the right to re-use this content. The beneficiaries of this concept are not only science, but also society and the economy.

Open Science is realised through various strategies and procedures, such as free access to scientific publications (Open Access), computer programmes (Open Source Software), data (Open Data) and educational materials (Open Educational Resources).

### The 4 Rs of Open Science
When opening your science think about the 4 Rs:

- **Reliable.** It is important to evaluate the research in two ways. First with respect to scientific principles and criteria like validity, second with respect to criteria out of the professional context. This will help ensure that your results are more reliable.
- **Reproducible.** Transparency is critical when doing research. Open Science allows you to clearly show what you've done to get the results you have. By being open about your methods, processes and decision making during your research, someone else doing the research again should get the same results.
- **Reusable.** This is the same R we mentioned when we talked about FAIR. By making a research results reusable, you allow others to build upon the solid foundation your research has already created in a given subject.
- **Relevant.** Research quality describes the measurable influence of academic research on the academic community. Research impact includes environmental, cultural and societal impact, economic returns and societal benefits.

### The four pillars of Open Science
> Maybe drop this here: is too repetitive and will be covered in the respective sections again

The four pillars of Open Science are: 

- **Data.** Data-driven research is fast becoming the norm in all disciplines. To support validation of your findings and allow others to build upon your work, you first need to make sure that others can find your data. This means giving them unique identifiers (such as DOIs); putting them into a repository that supports public searching; and being clear about what others can and can't do with them by applying an appropriate license. Check out our course on managing and sharing research data for more information. To find the right license for your outputs, check out our open licensing course
- **Code.** When sharing your software and code, be sure to make use of open source standards to support interoperability and their longer-term viability. Be sure to put your code somewhere that others can search for it and access it (e.g., Github). You should also be clear about the license the code is being shared under. Learn more about looking after your code in our course covering open source software and workflows. Our course on open licensing will help you to find the best option for your software outputs. 
- **Papers.** Open Access to publications is a key component of Open Science. Free and instant access to publications improves the speed of innovation and leads better cooperation and progress in solving grand challenges. To publish openly, you'll need to be able to source an appropriate OA journal or discipline specific repository and navigate your way through their publishing agreements. You should also consider sharing preprints of your work as a means of getting early feedback and community validation of your approaches. In some cases, you'll need to pay an Article Processing Charge to publish in an OA journal. Learn more about these issues in our Open Access publishing course.  
- **Reviews.** The peer review process is evolving. By making the peer review process more transparent, researchers have better access to peer feedback at an earlier stage in the lifecycle and consumers of research outputs can have greater confidence in their quality. Learn more about how this in our open peer review (OPR) course. 

But there is way more to discover about Open Science. The Open [Science Taxonomy graphic](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1508606.v3, "Knoth, Petr; Pontika, Nancy (2015): Open Science Taxonomy. figshare. Figure. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1508606.v3") shows the different terms behind Open Science.

## What is FAIR?
### Definition of FAIR
In 2016, FORCE11 – a group of researchers as well as employees of libraries, archives, publishers and funders – established principles for the handling of research data. The so-called FAIR principles comprise four goals: the findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability of data. With the achievement of these goals, the sustainable re-usability of research data is meant to be guaranteed.

- **Findable**
  
  - The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.
    
    - F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    - F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
    - F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
    - F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

- **Accessible**
  
  - Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
    
    - A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
    - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
    - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
    - A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

- **Interoperable**
  
  - The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.
    
    - I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
    - I2. (Meta)data use standards, formats and vocabularies that follow FAIR principles and allow it to be exchanged and combined across computer systems
    - I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

- **Reusable**
  
  - The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings
    
    - R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
    - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
    - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
    - R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
  
  - Licenses: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
