### What is FAIR?
- Definition of FAIR

  - The Fairification Process: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/ 
- Examples for every letter
  - Findable: 
    - The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.
  - Accessible: 
    - Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
  - Interoperable: 
    - The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. 
  - Reusable:
    - The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.
