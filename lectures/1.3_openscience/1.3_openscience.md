## Why do we need Open Science

#### Video: Why do we need open science - ESA's point of view

Space Agencies and International Organisations across the globe promote Open Science and support its practice by the scientific community through dedicated programmes. This course, for example, is part of the support to Earth Observation Open Science by the European Space Agency (ESA). 

ESA, just like other European organisations such as the European Commission, has a long standing commitment to Open Science. A prominent example is the provision of full free and open Earth Observation data from its science missions (i.e. the Earth Explorers) and from the Copernicus Programme (e.g. the Sentinel missions). However, Open Science goes much beyond open data. ESA's vision for Open Science covers the full research cycle (see ESA vision figure). Simply put, a piece of research fully adheres to Open Science principles if:

- all the data, code, and documentation of the respective research are FAIR see [What is FAIR?](https://github.com/EO-College/cubes-and-clouds/blob/main/lectures/1.3_openscience/1.3_openscience.md#what-is-fair) section, Open and linked to one another
- the research is reproducible across various platforms (i.e. cloud platforms or computational systems)
- the research is maintained so that it is accessible to the community in the long-term

This requires that the scientific community adheres to the same common (or compatible) practices when writing and documenting code, preparing and sharing data or publishing their research in journals.

## What is Open Science?
### Open Science
Open Science offers new opportunities in dealing with scientific knowledge and represents a kind of cultural change. Through transparency and openness, Open Science increases the use and further development of knowledge as well as the potential for collaboration and the credibility of science. The focus is on free access to scientific processes and findings for everyone via the internet and the right to re-use this content. The beneficiaries of this concept are not only science, but also society and the economy.

Open Science is realised through various strategies and procedures, such as free access to scientific publications (Open Access), computer programmes (Open Source Software), data (Open Data) and educational materials (Open Educational Resources).

### The 4 Rs of Open Science
When opening your science think about the 4 Rs:

- **Reliable.** It is important to evaluate the research in two ways. First with respect to scientific principles and criteria like validity, second with respect to criteria out of the professional context. This will help ensure that your results are more reliable.
- **Reproducible.** Transparency is critical when doing research. Open Science allows you to clearly show what you've done to get the results you have. By being open about your methods, processes and decision making during your research, someone else doing the research again should get the same results.
- **Reusable.** By making a research results reusable, you allow others to build upon the solid foundation your research has already created in a given subject. This is the same R that is also going to be mentioned in the FAIR principles.
- **Relevant.** Research quality describes the measurable influence of academic research on the academic community. Research impact includes environmental, cultural and societal impact, economic returns and societal benefits. By adhering to open science you increase the chances of your research to be relevant, because you give others the chance to interact with it.

### The four pillars of Open Science
The four pillars of Open Science are: 

- **Data.** Data-driven research is fast becoming the norm in all disciplines. To support validation of your findings and allow others to build upon your work, you first need to make sure that others can find your data. This means giving them persistent and unique identifiers (such as DOIs); assigning appropiate metadata so that others can find and reuse your data; putting them into a repository that supports public searching; and being clear about what others can and can't do with them by applying an appropriate license. In the Further Reading section you find links to courses about managing and sharing research data and licensing your outputs.
- **Code.** When sharing your software and code, be sure to make use of open source standards to support interoperability and their longer-term viability. Be sure to put your code somewhere that others can search for it and access it (e.g., Github). Additionally, you can give your code a DOI by registering your Github repo on Zenodo. You should also be clear about the license the code is being shared under. In the Further Reading section there's a course about Open Source Software.
- **Papers.** Open Access (OA) to publications is a key component of Open Science. Free and instant access to publications improves the speed of innovation and leads better cooperation and progress in solving grand challenges. To publish openly, you'll need to be able to source an appropriate OA journal or discipline-specific repository and navigate your way through their publishing agreements. You should also consider sharing preprints of your work as a means of getting early feedback and community validation of your approaches. In some cases, you'll need to pay an Article Processing Charge to publish in an OA journal. 
- **Reviews.** The peer review process is evolving. By making the peer review process more transparent, researchers have better access to peer feedback at an earlier stage in the lifecycle and consumers of research outputs can have greater confidence in their quality. 

But there is way more to discover about Open Science. The Open [Science Taxonomy graphic](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1508606.v3 "Knoth, Petr; Pontika, Nancy (2015): Open Science Taxonomy. figshare. Figure. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1508606.v3") shows the different terms behind Open Science.

## What is FAIR?
### FAIR
In 2014, a group of researchers as well as employees of libraries, archives, publishers and funders – established principles for the handling of research data in a workshop and published them on FORCE11 for reviews and comments. The so-called FAIR principles were born. They comprise four goals: the findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability of data. With the achievement of these goals, the sustainable re-usability of research data is meant to be guaranteed. FAIR is not binary: FAIR is a spectrum!

> The OpenAIRE definition of Metadata: Metadata is data providing information about data that makes findable, trackable and (re)usable. It can include information such as contact information, geographic locations, details about units of measure, abbreviations or codes used in the dataset, instrument and protocol information, survey tool details, provenance and version information and much more. In earth observation satellite data that could be the spatial and temporal extent of the data, the sensor, the bands and their wavelenghts, etc. Section [2.1 Data Discovery](https://github.com/EO-College/cubes-and-clouds/blob/main/lectures/2.1_data_discovery/2.1_data_discovery.md) and [2.2 Data Properties](https://github.com/EO-College/cubes-and-clouds/blob/main/lectures/2.2_data_properties/2.2_data_properties.md) deal with EO metadata in particular.

- **Findable**
  
  - The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.
    
    - F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    - F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
    - F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
    - F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
  
  - Persistent Identifier (PID): These are IDs that identify a data set, publication or software (any digital object) unambiguosly and persistently with a single link. It increases the findability of a resource drastically. A widely used identifier is the [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/).

- **Accessible**
  
  - Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.
    
    - A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
    - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
    - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
    - A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

- **Interoperable**
  
  - The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.
    
    - I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
    - I2. (Meta)data use standards, formats and vocabularies that follow FAIR principles and allow it to be exchanged and combined across computer systems
    - I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

- **Reusable**
  
  - The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings
    
    - R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
    - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
    - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
    - R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
  
  - Licenses: To make your data reusable the use of appropiate licenses is key. Here is a good starting point to learn about the widely used [creative commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=en).

## What is Open Data?

### Open Data
Open data is data that **anyone can access, use and share**. Open data becomes usable when made available in a common, machine-readable format. **Open data must be licensed**. Its licence must permit people to use the data in any way they want, including transforming, combining and sharing it with others, even commercially. Any restrictions imposed on the use of open data will limit its potential for creating new value.

- **Limitations:** For data to be open, it should have no limitations that prevent it from being used in any particular way. Anyone should be free to use, modify, combine and share the data, even commercially
- **Cost:** Open data must be free to use, but this does not mean that it must be free to access. There is often a cost to creating, maintaining and publishing usable data. Ideally, any fee for accessing open data should be no more than the reasonable reproduction cost of the unit of data that is requested. This reproduction cost tends to be negligible for many datasets. Live data and big data can incur ongoing costs related to reliable service provision.
- **Reuse:** Once the user has the data, they are free to use, reuse and redistribute it – even commercially. Open data is measured by what it can be used for, not by how it is made available. Aspects like format, structure and machine readability all make data more usable, and should all be carefully considered. However, these do not make the data more open.
- **FAIR vs Open Data:** FAIR data is not the same as open data. For example, it is not always possible to grant free access to data for economic and legal reasons. Restrictions on access are compatible with FAIR principles, as long as the conditions and ways of access are evident.

## What is Open Source?
### Open Source
Open Source does not simply mean that the source code of a project is available, which is only one element of an Open Source project. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) provides a commonly accepted [definition](https://opensource.org/osd/) of what constitutes Open Source. To summarize that, in order to be considered Open Source: 

- Open Source Software needs a license, 
- a work has to allow free redistribution, 
- the source code needs to be made available, 
- it must be possible to create further works based on it, 
- there must be no limitations of who may use the work or for what purpose (so something like "no commercial use" or "no military use" won't work with Open Source),
- the work must not require an additional license on top of the one it comes with,
- and finally, the license must not depend on a specific distribution format, technology or presence of other works.

![OSI's Open Source Definition](https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/ZKAG4bUVsMBQalassQyg8/8efbbe929562b2a06c16b6ab154b5335/Frame_599.png?w=1280&fm=webp "OSI's Open Source Definition")

## The Open Science Journey - Open Science in geospatial, EO and EO cloud platforms
Finally let's see how open science principles are applied in the field of geospatial, earth observation and EO cloud platforms. To begin we will have a look at the open science journey and a research project that has adapted openness and the FAIR principles very well. Then we will have a look at the role open science plays in today's geospatial and EO world.

### The Role of Open Source Software in Geospatial - The example of GDAL
Open Science plays an important role in geospatial. Open source software is a part of that and the Geographic Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) software is a great example of how important open source software is in the geospatial world. 
Paul Ramsey, the co-founder of the PostGIS extension, has described what GDAL is in a metaphoric way in a [mapscaping.com podcast](https://mapscaping.com/podcast/gdal-geospatial-data-abstraction-library/): “GDAL is data plumbing, a bit like an international electrical plug set for traveling — it’s got multiple different shaped plugs. Electricity is “just” electrons moving around. But they can move around as DC, AC, 120 volts or 240 volts. Plus, there are all these different ways you can plug and join electrical things. At the core, electricity is electrons vibrating, but it can be quite complex to get your hair dryer spinning.”
Howard Butler, a director of the Open-Source Geospatial Foundation, said about the importance of GDAL:  “[…] It's open, it provides core functionality, I can't understand how anybody gets anything done without it.“ 

#### Video: The Role of Open Source Software in Geospatial - The example of GDAL

### Open Science in EO Cloud Platforms
- **Code:** Workflows and Code can easily be shared on EO Cloud Platforms. There are openly available tutorial notebooks. Workflows can be shared as user defined processes and be reused by the community. There are user forums that share solutions and snippets. OpenEO, a standardized processing API for EO in the cloud, allows code to be portable between different cloud platforms. This increases reprodicibility, collaboration and prevents vendor locks. **Image Slider:** openEO Platform Forum, Tutorial Notebooks Microsoft Planetary Computer, User Defined Processes openEO, 

- **Results:** There are multiple ways to share results created in EO cloud platforms. Ideally they can be ingested into the platform and be made available as collections for other users directly upon creation. If the result comes with appropiate metadata (e.g. according to the STAC specification) they can easily be registered in publicly avialable STAC Catalogues. Cloud Native Data Formats (described in more detail in lesson [2.4 Formats and Performance](2.4_formats_and_performance)), like cloud optimized geotiff, are accessible via https requests. So instead of sharing a file, only a URL pointing to the file is shared. **Image Slider**: Collection in a Platform, STAC Catalogue, Link to a COG

- **Publication:** If a publication is built on top of results produced in an EO cloud platform, the results and code can easily be linked to the publication in one of the forms described aboved. For example, you can publish your openEO process graph and link to it, and provide a link to a STAC Catalogue where the results are accessible. **Example of a Publication where the code is available on a cloud platform**

- **FAIRness:** 
  - Findable: Data is usually presented through a data catalogue (e.g. STAC Catalogues are used in openEO platform and the Microsoft Planetary Computer) that is explicitly made for searching data. In many cases searching data works even without registration on the platform.
  - Accessible: Data access in cloud platforms is usually granted after registration and authentication. Since cloud computing resources can easily be misused a certain degree of access control is necessary.
  - Interoperable: Processing standards like openEO aim at making the code interoperable, which means it is transferable between platforms. Standardised metadata attached to the results,the use of cloud optimized formats and reingestion of the results into the platform guarantee easy uptake of the results right away. Different sources of satellite data are made interoperable by the cloud platform through the use of data cubes and processing on the fly - reprojections, regridding and temporal alignment are enabled on the fly.
  - Reusable: To make results reusable for others, they need to be accessible and have an open license. Ideally, a license of choice can be added to the metadata and the results are reingested into the platform as a public collection, available for everyone.

- **Analysis Ready Data (ARD):** Analysis Ready Data are in the context of EO cloud platforms are usually satellite data that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort and interoperability both through time and with other datasets. This means for example that atmospheric correction and cloud masking has already been applied to optical data. Many collections on cloud platforms are analysis ready, so that users can directly start the analysis withouth the tedious and technically demanding preprocessing steps. Since 'analysis ready' can mean different things to different people, CEOS is working on standardizing what analysis ready data are.

## Exam
Let's test your theoretical knowledge on open science now. It's important that you understand these concepts. We will apply them later on in the course!

### Open Science
What do the 4 Rs in the context of Open Science stand for?

    [( )] Readable, refreshable, recognizable, and receivable
    [(X)] Reliable, reproducable, reusable, and relevant
    [( )] Recitable, renameable, replicatable, and repairable.

Which statement is correct about Open Science?

    [( )] Open Science sounds good, but it is unfair because researchers with limited financial means cannot afford access to open research results.
    [(X)] Open Science promotes the transparency of science and the free reuse of existing research results by everyone.
    [( )] Open Science ensures better networking of researchers within the EU. A worldwide exchange is currently not possible.

What are the arguments in favour of Open Data?

    [( )] Generally, open data is not subject to a review process, so this type of data publication is always significantly faster.
    [( )] Lower costs and less time needed to prepare the data than with a closed access publication.
    [(X)] Accessibility of scientific data and metadata, source texts and digital reproductions.

### FAIR
FAIR is an acronym that stands for...

    [(X)] Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable
    [( )] Fast Artificial Intelligence Research
    [( )] Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful Education
    [( )] Free, Available, Implemented and Ready

Findable means...

    [[X]] (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    [[ ]] (Meta)data are optimized to show up in the highest positions in google searches
    [[X]] (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

Accessible means…

    [[ ]] (Meta)data must be open.
    [[X]] (Meta)data does not necessarily have to be open.
    [[X]] (Meta)data has access conditions and these are clear to both humans and machines.
    [[ ]] (Meta)data is open for access, but not for reuse.

Interoperable means...

    [( )] (Meta)data is created and described by at least two researchers from differenct institutes
    [(X)] (Meta)data use standards, formats and vocabularies that allow it to be exchanged and combined across computer systems and between humans

Reusable means…

    [(X)] the data has clear usage licenses and is usable by both people and machines.
    [( )] that all data is usable.
    [( )] the data has clear usage licenses to be used by people.

### Open Data and Open Source
Which statement about Open Data is correct?

    [(X)] Open Data means information that is freely accessible.
    [( )] With Open Data, only data that is related to a scientific interpretation can be considered.
    [( )] With Open Data, the availability and usability of data on the web is limited.

FAIR data is always open data.

    [( )] True
    [(X)] False

What is true about Open Source Softwarte projects

    [[X]] The source code is completely available to the public.
    [[ ]] You cannot contribute to Open Source Software Projects.
    [[X]] Open Source Software Projects are community driven.
    [[X]] You can never use Open Source Software for commercial purposes.
    [[ ]] If software is published under a license, it is not open source.

What is GitHub?

    [( )] GitHub is a cloud storage system specialized in storing big earth observation data sets.
    [(X)] GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

Questions to openstreetmap.org check what is true

- How/Why is it open
    - OpenStreetMap® is open data, licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF). (https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)
- What is the community effect of Open Street Map:
  - Citizen science - contributions from everybody. One of the most detailed sources of local-scale map data available (https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).
- Open Science in the Cloud:
  - The Open Street Map base map is used as a background layer in almost every webmapping tool available. It allows users to quickly recognize the location of EO data to the known features on a map (i.e., country borders, streets, buildings).
    - Show result of EO data without a base map, upon click: and with a base map to illustrate how base maps help recognizing the data spatially.

To which extent is Google Earth Engine suitable for Open Science. Tick what is correct. *Up for discussion this question, I think it's quite controversial, and for sure has different opinions - but also makes the students think*
