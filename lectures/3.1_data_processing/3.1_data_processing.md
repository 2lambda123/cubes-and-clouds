# 3.1 Data Processing

## Topics
- Building an EO workflow with the available processes of a platform
- How openEO functions are defined (input, arguments, output)
- Data fusion
- Tracking resources

## Animations
- ???

## Exercises
- Perform the necessary steps of the snow workflow
- Probably needs to be split in multiple lectures
- Or the amount of predefined code is quite large
- Just an idea but we could let students choose a not yet computed area and combine the results and show on a combined map

## Available Material
- EDC App: EO4Alps Snow
- Would be cool to link to an app that is deployed somewhere on a cloud

## Speakers
- METER Group, user perspective, potential use cases
