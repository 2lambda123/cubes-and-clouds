# 3.1 Data Processing

## Learning Objectives
- Carry out an EO workflow on a cloud platform
- Select suitable data
- Chain processes to form an EO processing chain/workflow
- Visualize the results

## Introdcution
In this lecture we are going to combine the knowledge and hands-on experience we have gathered so far to create a full EO workflow on a cloud platform.
We will  
- define a research question,
- choose and load the necessary data sources, 
- define the data cube to our needs, 
- use functions to process the data, 
- visualize the result
- and track the resources we are consuming on the platform.

## Case Study: Snow Cover in the Alps

### Research Question
Describe the research question. Why are we interested in snow cover

### Data Choices
Explain which data we are going to us, and which data we could use.

### Excursion: Using multiple Data Sources on a cloud platform. Data Fusion
What is to be considered when doing data fusion:
- Extent (time, space, bands)
- Resolution (time, space, bands; what is the information in the bands - is it comparable...)
- Dimensionality
- illustrate this with data cube models

How to solve this on a cloud platform!
- Checking the extent of the collections
- Aligning the extent of the collections
- Aligning the resolution of the collections (aggregating, resampling, reducing)

### Workflow Description
- Describe the functions we are using one by one, and what happens to the data cube.
- embed process graph as html

### Excursion: How openEO functions are defined (input, arguments, output) 
Speaker Jeroen Dries, Matthias Mohr

## Tracking resources
- Explain Basics of resource usage on cloud platforms
- Point to Scaling Lesson: There we can go more into details

## Hands On Exercise
Now we have covered the most important topics of our use case in theory. Let's move on to produce some results!

## Quiz
### Theory Part
- Which parts are necessary to define an openEO process (is present in every openEO process definition)
- Explain how to avoid unneccesary waste of resources on cloud platforms

### Exercise Part
- How many pixels are we looking at
- How many resources did we use up to this state
- How many snow covered pixels are there across all time steps?
- At which time step is the maximum snow cover reached? 
- What is the number of snow covered pixels on that date?
- What does that represent in area (km2)?
- How is the relation between snow cover and runoff?
  - Show different diagrams, the should choose the correct one

## Notes
### Topics
- Building an EO workflow with the available processes of a platform
- How openEO functions are defined (input, arguments, output)
- Data fusion
- Tracking resources

### Animations
- Put the full process graph as html to be inspected

### Exercises
- Perform the necessary steps of the snow workflow
- Probably needs to be split in multiple lectures
- Or the amount of predefined code is quite large
- Just an idea but we could let students choose a not yet computed area and combine the results and show on a combined map

### Available Material
- EDC App: EO4Alps Snow
- Would be cool to link to an app that is deployed somewhere on a cloud

### Speakers
- METER Group, user perspective, potential use cases
- Any Commercial User of a cloud platform
