# How to contribute
## Types of contributions
We're happy to receive contributions to improve the quality of the course. Here are some potential areas where help would be greatly appreciated

- **Report Bugs:** If any of the exercises are not working. Please report a bug here by opening an issue.
- **Fix Bugs:** Make a pull request with your fix.
